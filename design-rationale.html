        <h1>Design Rationale for Bakery Website</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>These are the sites I used in my research:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://sanremobakery.com/">Sanremo</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.torontobread.com/">Toronto Bread Company</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://therollingpin.ca/">The Rolling Pin</a></li>
            </ul>
            <!--  
                Links to the three sites you looked at. Use anchor tags with href <a href="">
                -->
        </section>
        <!-- You can fill in the rest. Remember to add an obvious link to this page on each page of your website.-->

            <h3>The audience for the site</h3>
            <p>In theory, this bakery opens to everyone. However, considering the location, it mainly focuses on residents of the GTA. They don't have online shopping or delivery service, so we are expecting more customers to come to our store.  Potential customers are young people who love sweets, office people who want a coffee break, and anyone who needs a cake for their special days. Searching keywords could be: bakery, Toronto, bread, cake, dessert.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The site metaphor</h3>
            <p>I want to show customers that our bakers are experienced and professional. We use fresh ingredients to make healthy food every day. Therefore, I can use brown as my theme color, maybe add some warm colors to support it. Brown is the main color of baked food. It will match those pictures I put on the web page. Also, brown symbolizes welcoming, honest, and sincere.</p>
            <p>Also, I want to show them that this bakery has good quality products. All the pictures will be well-organized, bright, and colorful. This will be customers' first impression, so it is important to make them attractive. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Summarize the design of your design</h3>
            <p>I'd like to create a modern-style web page, well-organized and easy to read. I will have a section on the home page to introduce the bakery, including its history, business concept, and staff. I will put a picture aside and have a gallery section below for all popular products. On the menu page, I will list all the products in categories.  Each item will have pictures aside. On the contact page, I will have all the contact info such as address, phone number, business hours, etc. </p>
            <p>For style-based features, I want to give the top navigation bar a fixed position. It will help customers navigate the website and find what they want easily. Second, I want to put a second navigation on the menu page for products in different categories. This allows customers to find the type of food they want quickly. Third, I will have a google map embedded, so that customers do not need to leave the website and check the address by themselves. Fourth, I will put a link to the contact page on every page. This will encourage customers to click on it and make contact. I will give all the buttons a hover effect as well. So that customers will know those are clickable.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Obstacles and challenges</h3>
            <p>1. For better navigation, I want to have a drop-down menu for “menu”. It lists the different product categories such as cake, bread, donut, etc. Because I don't know how to achieve that now, I can have the product list on the menu page and create same-page navigation.  </p>
            <p>2. I want to have an online shopping system to submit orders or chat with staff online. But for now, I can only do a contact form instead.</p>
            <p>3. I'd like a slide show on the top of my home page. For now, I only have a single image.</p>
            <p>4. I want to have a hamburger menu for responsive purposes. What I have right now is using flexbox to adjust the space between list items. </p>
